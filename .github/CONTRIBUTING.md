# Contributing

## Pages
* Pages should go in the `_pages` folder.
* All pages should have, at minimum, a permalink in their header information. See `_pages/about.md` for an example.

## Posts
* Posts go in the `_posts` folder.
* Posts get named in the scheme `YEAR-Month-Day-Title.md` (ie `2016-09-14-Test.md`). No spaces in the filename.
* If this is your first post, add an entry in `_data/authors.yml` with some info about yourself. See `_config.yml` for a full list of attributes you can assign yourself.
* Ensure you have appropriate header information. At minimum this should include author information.
