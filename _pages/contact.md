# Contact Us

## [IRC](/irc)

We have a few IRC rooms on the ImaginaryNet server. If you want to come and chat to us right away,
[follow this link](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.imaginarynet.uk:+6697#compsoc)!

## Slack

We also have [a Slack set up](https://compsoc.slack.com)! This is connected to our IRC network
through a bridge linking the two. This means you can talk to people on IRC without even having
to join it.

## Facebook

See our latest events on [our Facebook page](https://fb.me/compsoc).

Send us an email at [committee@comp-soc.com](mailto:committee@comp-soc.com)!
