This is the official website of The University of Edinburgh Artificial Intelligence and Computing Society, aka CompSoc. If you want to know more about who we are please take a look at the about page. The site is completely new, after having lost much of our old one we decided to make a new one!

Anyway you're probably itching to grab the valuable information and latest updates on CompSoc's activities, so go ahead and explore!

If you have any questions, particularly if you are a student of the University of Edinburgh, or representative of a University of Edinburgh Society do not hesitate to contact us. We will try to answer your question or requests. CompSoc aims to get people interested in Computing and understanding the impact it has brought, so don't worry we will try not to bite =)

I hope you will enjoy CompSoc and using this website to get your Computing fix!
