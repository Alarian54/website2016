# IRC
IRC is our awesome way of keeping in touch online. We have a channel on ImaginaryNet - #compsoc.

If you already have an IRC client set up on your computer, please [Click Here](ircs://irc.imaginarynet.uk/#compsoc) to join.

## I've never used IRC before!
Well, you're in luck. We've got a handy web client hosted by the kind folks over at the [TARDIS Project](https://tardis.ed.ac.uk/). It used to be called Shout, and is now called _The Lounge_. You can find it [here](http://shout.tardis.ed.ac.uk/).

## I already know how to IRC, just give me the details!
Perfect!
